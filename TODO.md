ZNS Integration (with GhostBridge + ENS/Unstoppable)

    I'm building a decentralized naming system called ZNS (Zig Name System) for the Ghostchain project. It's similar to ENS, but with better integration across DNS, gRPC, IPv6, and self-sovereign identity (DID/zkLogin). Here's what I'm building and what I need help with:
    üîê Core Goals:

        Human-readable identities like alice.zns

        Resolves to:

            Ed25519 / secp256k1 pubkeys

            IPv6 wallet node address

            Wallet metadata or dApp endpoints (via gRPC or HTTP)

        Optional DNS fallback via DNSSEC + DANE + OPENPGPKEY

        Compatible with .eth (ENS) and Unstoppable .crypto, .nft domains

    üì¶ What I need from you:

        ZNS Record Format (suggest schema):

            Name (string)

            Public key(s)

            Resolver endpoint (QUIC/gRPC)

            Expiration or version

            Signature (Ed25519 or secp256k1)

        ZNS Resolver Module in Zig:

            Parse .zns records

            Verify signature (via zcrypto)

            Fallback to DNS + ENS/Unstoppable via plugin if no ZNS record found

        gRPC Resolver Interface:

            ZNS will use GhostBridge, a Rust client ‚Üî Zig server bridge using gRPC

            Define a proto message like:

        message ZNSResolveRequest {
          string name = 1;
        }
        message ZNSResolveResponse {
          string pubkey = 1;
          string ipv6 = 2;
          string metadata_uri = 3;
        }

        The Zig server should return resolved ZNS records over gRPC via GhostBridge

    ENS & Unstoppable Integration:

        I want a resolver plugin system:

            zns resolve alice.eth should return Ethereum pubkey via ENS

            zns resolve dan.crypto should fetch via Unstoppable domain resolution

            Suggest how to integrate Web3 libraries or APIs for this fallback

üéØ CLI Goals:

zns resolve alice.zns           # ZNS resolution via GhostBridge
zns resolve ghostkellz.eth      # ENS fallback
zns resolve vault.nft           # Unstoppable fallback

Please help design the ZNS schema and gRPC handler with fallback support.
Optional: Suggest a plugin-based resolver pattern in Zig so zns can support .zns, .eth, .crypto, and .dev extensions with pluggable backends.
