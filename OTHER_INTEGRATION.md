# üåê Other Web3 Integration: Unstoppable Domains, Polygon, Stellar

> This document outlines planned support and technical requirements for integrating Ghostchain and GhostPlane with key Web3 ecosystems outside Ethereum.

---

## üîó Unstoppable Domains (.x, .crypto, .wallet, .nft, etc.)

### Purpose:

Enable resolution and authentication for decentralized identity and domains issued by [Unstoppable Domains](https://unstoppabledomains.com), natively through the ZNS module.

### Implementation Plan:

* [ ] Extend `zns` resolver to recognize and cache Unstoppable domain suffixes
* [ ] Interface with Unstoppable Domains resolution APIs via GraphQL or smart contract RPC
* [ ] Add support for signature verification from domain records (wallet, address, content hash)
* [ ] Allow mapping `.gsig` or `GID` to Unstoppable domain profile

---

## üü£ Polygon Network Support (EVM-Compatible)

### Purpose:

Allow GhostPlane and GhostChain to interoperate with dApps and contracts deployed on the Polygon chain, enabling fast L2-compatible bridging.

### Implementation Plan:

* [ ] Extend GhostBridge or GhostVM to support Polygon RPC (Alchemy, Infura, etc.)
* [ ] Add cross-chain bridging contract templates (ZVM-compatible) for Polygon ‚Üî GhostChain swaps
* [ ] Enable MetaMask and WalletConnect support in web UI
* [ ] Add zk-compatible transaction proofs for trustless bridging
* [ ] Use `ghostbridge` as gateway module to Polygon

---

## üí∏ Stellar + RLUSD Integration

### Purpose:

Enable on-chain payments, swaps, and stablecoin-backed reserves using Stellar and RealLayer USD (RLUSD).

### Implementation Plan:

* [ ] Implement support for Stellar's Horizon API in `ghostbridge`
* [ ] Add RLUSD smart contract templates compatible with `keystone`
* [ ] Create wrapped token bridge from RLUSD ‚Üí GCC/MANA tokens
* [ ] Enable DID-to-Stellar address mapping via `sigil`
* [ ] Add relay server or payment endpoint to support fiat-backed gateways

## üîß Dependencies & Required Modules

| Dependency    | Purpose                          |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `ghostbridge` | Cross-chain communication        |
| `keystone`    | Transaction and state ledger     |
| `sigil`       | Identity mapping and auth        |
| `zns`         | Domain and Web3 resolution       |
| `covenant`    | Conditional contract enforcement |

---

## üìç Future Goals

* Native `.x`/`.eth` resolution via `ghostd`
* GhostPlane zk-powered relayer for Polygon rollups
* RLUSD-as-gas support for mobile/lightweight wallets
* DNS-over-ZNS fallback resolution through HTTP3 (GhostWire)
